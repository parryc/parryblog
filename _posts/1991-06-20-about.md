I have an undying love for language: everything from computational linguistics to Mandarin Chinese to typography. 
<br/>
I am an avid traveler (if home is where the heart is, then my heart is eating samsas and drinking beer in Almaty, Kazakhstan) and I love to play badminton.  <br/>
I am a budding beer drinker and a journeyman mixologist. <br/> 
I like puns, video games, and pretty things. <br/>
I like steampunk, biopunk, and cyberpunk, but not really British punk. <br/>
I can spin various objects on my pointer finger. <br/>
I collect records. <br/>
I swear by LaTeX. <br/>
And I have a surprising number of dictionaries to and from languages I can't read.
